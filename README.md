# ChessGame

This is a 2-player chess game with an AI component, developed by Ghafor, Ibrahim, and Ismail.

The game will be implemented using Java and will allow two players to play against each other on a physical board or against the AI. The AI will use various algorithms and heuristics to make intelligent moves, providing a challenging opponent for human players.

The project will be hosted on GitHub and will be open source, allowing other developers to contribute and make improvements. The code will be well-documented and adhere to best practices to ensure its quality and maintainability.

We are excited to bring this classic game to life with our own unique twist, and we hope you will enjoy playing it as much as we enjoy developing it.
